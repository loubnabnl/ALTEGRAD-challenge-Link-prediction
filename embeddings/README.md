# Link prediction embeddings

The embeddings can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12-S1WVQUfJWk5-cb-w8HqnKJjjRdP_gq?usp=sharing).

We used Node embeddings using Node2vec, abstract embeddings using SciBERT and Word2vec, as well as author embeddings using NetMF on the nodes of a graph of authors we generated.
